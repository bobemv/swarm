Small 2D game about hordes of enemies. This is my 2D project while learning Unity. Iâ€™ve always liked tower defense games and I think it was a fun game to practice what I have learnt. I also wanted to convey the feeling of being overwhelmed by hordes of enemies but emerging victorous in the end.

## Things I have learnt/done

- Multiples state pattern implementations to control unit behaviours.
- Line Renderer (from Unity) to draw lines ingame.
- A bit of post-processing to bloom brightly bullets.
- Horde system with enemy respawns making it easy to create custom hordes using the editor.
- Using OOP to create ally and enemy classes:
